For this project I referenced the websites geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow, etc. to get a general idea for the project and how to imlment a min heap. I also watched the video posted by Anna to see what the program is asking for and what it should look like after being executed. I also referenced the java sheet for commands as well as the LocalDateTime link Anna put in the class to find functions regarding how to use time in the code.
Before starting, I talked to TAs regarding how to aprroach the problem and they gave me advice on how to wirte helper methods constructors, etc. 
For the thought process of the actual code, while I didn't work with anyone specificially for the code, I did have a chat with fellow peers on how to approach the code as well as what should be included for the code to run.
For the writing of the code, I wrote it taking into consideration on what I have learned, and added comments to show each step of my thinking process.
