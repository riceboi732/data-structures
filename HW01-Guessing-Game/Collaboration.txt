For this project, I did not collaborate with any of my peers. However, I did visit piazza sometimes to address some of my questions. I was able to find some answers on there and didn't bother to repeat what has already been asked. 

For external sources, I did watch some youtube videos (credit to Cave of Programming) and his java tutorials (honestly really good videos, can't give the guy enough credit)
